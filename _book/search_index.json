You might already be familiar with many aspects of probability, however, formalization of the concepts is new for most. This chapter aims to introduce probability on familiar terms using processes most people have seen before. 10.1 Defining probability 10.1.1 Intro Questions Q1: A “die”, the singular of dice, is a cube with six faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. What is the chance of getting 1 when rolling a die S1: If the die is fair, then the chance of a 1 is as good as the chance of any other number. Since there are six outcomes, the chance must be 1-in-6 or, equivalently, \\(1/6\\). Q2: What is the chance of getting a 1 or 2 in the next roll S2: 1 and 2 constitute two of the six equally likely possible outcomes, so the chance of getting one of these two outcomes must be \\(2/6 = 1/3\\). Q3: What is the chance of getting either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 on the next roll S3: 100%. The outcome must be one of these numbers. Q4: What is the chance of not rolling a 2 S4: Since the chance of rolling a 2 is \\(1/6\\) or \\(16.\\bar{6}\\%\\), the chance of not rolling a 2 must be \\(100\\% - 16.\\bar{6}\\%=83.\\bar{3}\\%\\) or \\(5/6\\). Alternatively, we could have noticed that not rolling a 2 is the same as getting a 1, 3, 4, 5, or 6, which makes up five of the six equally likely outcomes and has probability \\(5/6\\). Q5: Consider rolling two dice. If \\(1/6^{th}\\) of the time the first die is a 1 and \\(1/6^{th}\\) of those times the second die is a 1, what is the chance of getting two 1s S: If \\(16.\\bar{6}\\)% of the time the first die is a 1 and \\(1/6^{th}\\) of those times the second die is also a 1, then the chance that both dice are 1 is \\((1/6)\\times (1/6)\\) or \\(1/36\\). 10.1.2 Probability We use probability to build tools to describe and understand apparent randomness. We often frame probability in terms of a random process giving rise to an . Roll a die \\(\\rightarrow\\) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 Flip a coin \\(\\rightarrow\\) H or T Rolling a die or flipping a coin is a seemingly random process and each gives rise to an outcome. Def of Probability The probability of an outcome is the proportion of times the outcome would occur if we observed the random process an infinite number of times. Probability is defined as a proportion, and it always takes values between 0 and 1 (inclusively). It may also be displayed as a percentage between 0% and 100%. Probability can be illustrated by rolling a die many times. Let \\(\\hat{p}_n\\) be the proportion of outcomes that are 1 after the first \\(n\\) rolls. As the number of rolls increases, \\(\\hat{p}_n\\) will converge to the probability of rolling a 1, \\(p = 1/6\\). Figure 1.1 shows this convergence for 100,000 die rolls. The tendency of \\(\\hat{p}_n\\) to stabilize around \\(p\\) is described by the Law of Large Numbers. The fraction of die rolls that are 1 at each stage in a simulation. The proportion tends to get closer to the probability \\(1/6 \\approx 0.167\\) as the number of rolls increases. Def of Law of Large Numbers As more observations are collected, the proportion \\(\\hat{p}_n\\) of occurrences with a particular outcome converges to the probability \\(p\\) of that outcome. Occasionally the proportion will veer off from the probability and appear to defy the Law of Large Numbers, as \\(\\hat{p}_n\\) does many times in Figure 1.1. However, these deviations become smaller as the number of rolls increases. Above we write \\(p\\) as the probability of rolling a 1. We can also write this probability as \\[\\begin{aligned} P(\\text{rolling a 1})\\end{aligned}\\] As we become more comfortable with this notation, we will abbreviate it further. For instance, if it is clear that the process is “rolling a die”, we could abbreviate \\(P(\\)rolling a 1\\()\\) as \\(P(\\)1\\()\\). Guided Practice Random processes include rolling a die and flipping a coin. Think of another random process. Describe all the possible outcomes of that process. For instance, rolling a die is a random process with potential outcomes 1, 2, ..., 6.1 What we think of as random processes are not necessarily random, but they may just be too difficult to understand exactly. The fourth example in the footnote solution to Guided Practice suggests a roommate’s behavior is a random process. However, even if a roommate’s behavior is not truly random, modeling her behavior as a random process can still be useful. Tip It can be helpful to model a process as random even if it is not truly random. 10.1.3 Disjoint or mutually exclusive outcomes Two outcomes are called disjoint or mutually exclusive if they cannot both happen. For instance, if we roll a die, the outcomes 1 and 2 are disjoint since they cannot both occur. On the other hand, the outcomes 1 and “rolling an odd number” are not disjoint since both occur if the outcome of the roll is a 1. The terms disjoint and mutually exclusive are equivalent and interchangeable. Calculating the probability of disjoint outcomes is easy. When rolling a die, the outcomes 1 and 2 are disjoint, and we compute the probability that one of these outcomes will occur by adding their separate probabilities: \\[\\begin{aligned} P(\\text{1 or 2}) = P(\\text{1})+P(\\text{2}) = 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3\\end{aligned}\\] What about the probability of rolling a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 Here again, all of the outcomes are disjoint so we add the probabilities: \\[\\begin{aligned} &amp;&amp;P(\\text{1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6}) \\\\ &amp;&amp;\\quad= P(\\text{1})+P(\\text{2})+P(\\text{3})+P(\\text{4})+P(\\text{5})+P(\\text{6}) \\\\ &amp;&amp;\\quad= 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 1.\\end{aligned}\\] The Addition Rule guarantees the accuracy of this approach when the outcomes are disjoint. Addition Rule of disjoint outcomes If \\(A_1\\) and \\(A_2\\) represent two disjoint outcomes, then the probability that one of them occurs is given by \\[\\begin{aligned} P(A_1\\text{ or } A_2) = P(A_1) + P(A_2)\\end{aligned}\\] If there are many disjoint outcomes \\(A_1\\), ..., \\(A_k\\), then the probability that one of these outcomes will occur is \\[\\begin{aligned} P(A_1) + P(A_2) + \\cdots + P(A_k)\\end{aligned}\\] Guided Practice We are interested in the probability of rolling a 1, 4, or 5. Explain why the outcomes 1, 4, and 5 are disjoint. Apply the Addition Rule for disjoint outcomes to determine \\(P(\\)1 or 4 or 5\\()\\).2 Statisticians rarely work with individual outcomes and instead consider or of outcomes. Let \\(A\\) represent the event where a die roll results in 1 or 2 and \\(B\\) represent the event that the die roll is a 4 or a 6. We write \\(A\\) as the set of outcomes \\(\\{\\)1, 2\\(\\}\\) and \\(B=\\{\\)4, 6\\(\\}\\). These sets are commonly called . Because \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) have no elements in common, they are disjoint events. \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are represented in Figure 1.2. Three events, \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(D\\), consist of outcomes from rolling a die. \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are disjoint since they do not have any outcomes in common. The Addition Rule applies to both disjoint outcomes and disjoint events. The probability that one of the disjoint events \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) occurs is the sum of the separate probabilities: \\[\\begin{aligned} P(A\\text{ or }B) = P(A) + P(B) = 1/3 + 1/3 = 2/3\\end{aligned}\\] Verify the probability of event \\(A\\), \\(P(A)\\), is \\(1/3\\) using the Addition Rule. Do the same for event \\(B\\).3 Using Figure 1.2 as a reference, what outcomes are represented by event \\(D\\) Are events \\(B\\) and \\(D\\) disjoint Are events \\(A\\) and \\(D\\) disjoint 4 In the Guided Practice above, you confirmed \\(B\\) and \\(D\\) from Figure 1.2 are disjoint. Compute the probability that either event \\(B\\) or event \\(D\\) occurs.5 10.1.4 Probabilities when events are not disjoint Let’s consider calculations for two events that are not disjoint in the context of a , represented in Table below. If you are unfamiliar with the cards in a regular deck, please see the footnote.6 Representations of the 52 unique cards in a deck. 2\\(\\clubsuit\\) 3\\(\\clubsuit\\) 4\\(\\clubsuit\\) 5\\(\\clubsuit\\) 6\\(\\clubsuit\\) 7\\(\\clubsuit\\) 8\\(\\clubsuit\\) 9\\(\\clubsuit\\) 10\\(\\clubsuit\\) J\\(\\clubsuit\\) Q\\(\\clubsuit\\) K\\(\\clubsuit\\) A\\(\\clubsuit\\) 2\\(\\diamondsuit\\) 3\\(\\diamondsuit\\) 4\\(\\diamondsuit\\) 5\\(\\diamondsuit\\) 6\\(\\diamondsuit\\) 7\\(\\diamondsuit\\) 8\\(\\diamondsuit\\) 9\\(\\diamondsuit\\) 10\\(\\diamondsuit\\) J\\(\\diamondsuit\\) Q\\(\\diamondsuit\\) K\\(\\diamondsuit\\) A\\(\\diamondsuit\\) 2\\(\\heartsuit\\) 3\\(\\heartsuit\\) 4\\(\\heartsuit\\) 5\\(\\heartsuit\\) 6\\(\\heartsuit\\) 7\\(\\heartsuit\\) 8\\(\\heartsuit\\) 9\\(\\heartsuit\\) 10\\(\\heartsuit\\) J\\(\\heartsuit\\) Q\\(\\heartsuit\\) K\\(\\heartsuit\\) A\\(\\heartsuit\\) 2\\(\\spadesuit\\) 3\\(\\spadesuit\\) 4\\(\\spadesuit\\) 5\\(\\spadesuit\\) 6\\(\\spadesuit\\) 7\\(\\spadesuit\\) 8\\(\\spadesuit\\) 9\\(\\spadesuit\\) 10\\(\\spadesuit\\) J\\(\\spadesuit\\) Q\\(\\spadesuit\\) K\\(\\spadesuit\\) A\\(\\spadesuit\\) Guided Practice What is the probability that a randomly selected card is a diamond What is the probability that a randomly selected card is a face card 7 Venn diagrams are useful when outcomes can be categorized as “in” or “out” for two or three variables, attributes, or random processes. The Venn diagram in Figure 1.3 uses a circle to represent diamonds and another to represent face cards. If a card is both a diamond and a face card, it falls into the intersection of the circles. If it is a diamond but not a face card, it will be in part of the left circle that is not in the right circle (and so on). The total number of cards that are diamonds is given by the total number of cards in the diamonds circle: \\(10+3=13\\). The probabilities are also shown (e.g. \\(10/52 = 0.1923\\)). A Venn diagram for diamonds and face cards. Guided Practice Using the Venn diagram, verify \\(P(\\)face card\\() = 12/52=3/13\\).8 Let \\(A\\) represent the event that a randomly selected card is a diamond and \\(B\\) represent the event that it is a face card. How do we compute \\(P(A\\) or \\(B)\\) Events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are not disjoint – the cards \\(J\\diamondsuit\\), \\(Q\\diamondsuit\\), and \\(K\\diamondsuit\\) fall into both categories – so we cannot use the Addition Rule for disjoint events. Instead we use the Venn diagram. We start by adding the probabilities of the two events: \\[\\begin{aligned} P(A) + P(B) = P({\\color{redcards}\\diamondsuit}) + P(\\text{face card}) = 12/52 + 13/52 \\label{overCountFaceDiamond}\\end{aligned}\\] However, the three cards that are in both events were counted twice, once in each probability. We must correct this double counting: \\[\\begin{aligned} P(A\\text{ or } B) &amp;=&amp;P(\\text{face card or }{\\color{redcards}\\diamondsuit}) \\notag \\\\ &amp;=&amp; P(\\text{face card}) + P({\\color{redcards}\\diamondsuit}) - P(\\text{face card and }{\\color{redcards}\\diamondsuit}) \\label{diamondFace} \\\\ &amp;=&amp; 12/52 + 13/52 - 3/52 \\notag \\\\ &amp;=&amp; 22/52 = 11/26 \\notag\\end{aligned}\\] The Equation above is an example of the General Addition Rule. General Addition Rule If \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are any two events, disjoint or not, then the probability that at least one of them will occur is \\[\\begin{aligned} P(A\\text{ or }B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A\\text{ and }B) \\label{generalAdditionRule}\\end{aligned}\\] where \\(P(A\\) and \\(B)\\) is the probability that both events occur. Tip When we write “or” in statistics, we mean “and/or” unless we explicitly state otherwise. Thus, \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) occurs means \\(A\\), \\(B\\), or both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) occur. Guided Practice If \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are disjoint, describe why this implies \\(P(A\\) and \\(B) = 0\\). Using part (a), verify that the General Addition Rule simplifies to the simpler Addition Rule for disjoint events if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are disjoint.9 In a given email data set with 3,921 emails, 367 were spam, 2,827 contained some small numbers but no big numbers, and 168 had both characteristics. Create a Venn diagram for this setup.10 Use your Venn diagram from (c) to determine the probability a randomly drawn email from the data set is spam and had small numbers (but not big numbers). What is the probability that the email had either of these attributes 11 10.1.5 Probability distributions A Probability distribution is a table of all disjoint outcomes and their associated probabilities. The table below shows the probability distribution for the sum of two dice. Probability distribution for the sum of two dice. Dice sum 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Probability \\(\\frac{1}{36}\\) \\(\\frac{2}{36}\\) \\(\\frac{3}{36}\\) \\(\\frac{4}{36}\\) \\(\\frac{5}{36}\\) \\(\\frac{6}{36}\\) \\(\\frac{5}{36}\\) \\(\\frac{4}{36}\\) \\(\\frac{3}{36}\\) \\(\\frac{2}{36}\\) \\(\\frac{1}{36}\\) Rules for probability distributions A probability distribution is a list of the possible outcomes with corresponding probabilities that satisfies three rules: The outcomes listed must be disjoint. Each probability must be between 0 and 1. The probabilities must total 1. Guided Practice The table below suggests three distributions for household income in the United States. Only one is correct. Which one must it be? What is wrong with the other two 12 Proposed distributions of US household incomes. Income range ($1000s) 0-25 25-50 50-100 100+ \\(a\\) 0.18 0.39 0.33 0.16 \\(b\\) 0.38 -0.27 0.52 0.37 \\(c\\) 0.28 0.27 0.29 0.16 Probability distributions can also be summarized in a bar plot. For instance, the distribution of US household incomes is shown in Figure 1.4 as a bar plot.13 The probability distribution for the sum of two dice is shown in the table at the begining of the probability distributions section and plotted in Figure 1.5. The probability distribution of US household income. The probability distribution of the sum of two dice. In these bar plots, the bar heights represent the probabilities of outcomes. If the outcomes are numerical and discrete, it is usually (visually) convenient to make a bar plot that resembles a histogram, as in the case of the sum of two dice. Another example of plotting the bars at their respective locations is shown in Figure 1.11 on page . 10.1.6 Complement of an event Rolling a die produces a value in the set \\(\\{\\)1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\(\\}\\). This set of all possible outcomes is called the sample space (\\(S\\)) for rolling a die. We often use the sample space to examine the scenario where an event does not occur. Let \\(D=\\{\\)2, 3\\(\\}\\) represent the event that the outcome of a die roll is 2 or 3. Then the complement of \\(D\\) represents all outcomes in our sample space that are not in \\(D\\), which is denoted by \\(D^c = \\{\\)1, 4, 5, 6\\(\\}\\). That is, \\(D^c\\) is the set of all possible outcomes not already included in \\(D\\). Figure 1.6 shows the relationship between \\(D\\), \\(D^c\\), and the sample space \\(S\\). Event \\(D=\\{\\)2, 3\\(\\}\\) and its complement, \\(D^c = \\{\\)1, 4, 5, 6\\(\\}\\). \\(S\\) represents the sample space, which is the set of all possible events. Guided Practice Compute \\(P(D^c) = P(\\)rolling a 1, 4, 5, or 6\\()\\). What is \\(P(D) + P(D^c)\\) 14 Events \\(A=\\{\\)1, 2\\(\\}\\) and \\(B=\\{\\)4, 6\\(\\}\\) are shown in Figure 1.2 on page . Guided Practice Write out what \\(A^c\\) and \\(B^c\\) represent. Compute \\(P(A^c)\\) and \\(P(B^c)\\). Compute \\(P(A)+P(A^c)\\) and \\(P(B)+P(B^c)\\).15 A complement of an event \\(A\\) is constructed to have two very important properties: (i) every possible outcome not in \\(A\\) is in \\(A^c\\), and (ii) \\(A\\) and \\(A^c\\) are disjoint. Property (i) implies \\[\\begin{aligned} P(A\\text{ or }A^c) = 1 \\label{complementSumTo1}\\end{aligned}\\] That is, if the outcome is not in \\(A\\), it must be represented in \\(A^c\\). We use the Addition Rule for disjoint events to apply Property (ii): \\[\\begin{aligned} P(A\\text{ or }A^c) = P(A) + P(A^c) \\label{complementDisjointEquation}\\end{aligned}\\] Combining the Equations above yields a very useful relationship between the probability of an event and its complement. Complement The complement of event \\(A\\) is denoted \\(A^c\\), and \\(A^c\\) represents all outcomes not in \\(A\\). \\(A\\) and \\(A^c\\) are mathematically related: \\[\\begin{aligned} \\label{complement} P(A) + P(A^c) = 1, \\quad\\text{i.e.}\\quad P(A) = 1-P(A^c)\\end{aligned}\\] In simple examples, computing \\(A\\) or \\(A^c\\) is feasible in a few steps. However, using the complement can save a lot of time as problems grow in complexity. Guided Practice Let \\(A\\) represent the event where we roll two dice and their total is less than 12. What does the event \\(A^c\\) represent Determine \\(P(A^c)\\) from the die sum table at the begining of the probability distribution section. Determine \\(P(A)\\).16 Consider again the probabilities from rolling two dice as in the table at the section on probability distributions. Find the following probabilities: The sum of the dice is not 6. The sum is at least 4, i.e. \\(\\{\\)4, 5, ..., 12\\(\\}\\). The sum is no more than 10. That is, determine the probability of the event \\(D=\\{\\)2, 3, ..., 10\\(\\}\\).17 10.1.7 Independence Just as variables and observations can be independent, random processes can be independent, too. Two processes are independent if knowing the outcome of one provides no useful information about the outcome of the other. For instance, flipping a coin and rolling a die are two independent processes – knowing the coin was heads does not help determine the outcome of a die roll. On the other hand, stock prices usually move up or down together, so they are not independent. The rolling two dice is a basic example of this. We want to determine the probability that both will be 1. Suppose one of the dice is red and the other white. If the outcome of the red die is a 1, it provides no information about the outcome of the white die. We first encountered this same question in in Q5 at the begining of this chapter, where we calculated the probability using the following reasoning: \\(1/6^{th}\\) of the time the red die is a 1, and \\(1/6^{th}\\) of those times the white die will also be 1. This is illustrated in Figure 1.7. Because the rolls are independent, the probabilities of the corresponding outcomes can be multiplied to get the final answer: \\((1/6)\\times(1/6)=1/36\\). This can be generalized to many independent processes. \\(1/6^{th}\\) of the time, the first roll is a 1. Then \\(1/6^{th}\\) of those times, the second roll will also be a 1. Example What if there was also a blue die independent of the other two? What is the probability of rolling the three dice and getting all 1s? If \\(1/36^{th}\\) of the time the white and red dice are both 1, then \\(1/6^{th}\\) of those times the blue die will also be 1, so multiply: \\[\\begin{aligned} P(white=\\text{1 and } red=\\text{1 and } blue=\\text{1}) &amp;= P(white=\\text{1})\\times P(red=\\text{1})\\times P(blue=\\text{1}) \\\\ &amp;= (1/6)\\times (1/6)\\times (1/6) = 1/216\\end{aligned}\\] The example above illustrate what is called the Multiplication Rule for independent processes. Multiplication Rule for independent processes If \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) represent events from two different and independent processes, then the probability that both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) occur can be calculated as the product of their separate probabilities: \\[\\begin{aligned} \\label{eqForIndependentEvents} P(A \\text{ and }B) = P(A) \\times P(B)\\end{aligned}\\] Similarly, if there are \\(k\\) events \\(A_1\\), ..., \\(A_k\\) from \\(k\\) independent processes, then the probability they all occur is \\[\\begin{aligned} P(A_1) \\times P(A_2)\\times \\cdots \\times P(A_k)\\end{aligned}\\] Guided Practice About 9% of people are left-handed. Suppose 2 people are selected at random from the U.S. population. Because the sample size of 2 is very small relative to the population, it is reasonable to assume these two people are independent. What is the probability that both are left-handed What is the probability that both are right-handed 18 Guided Practice Suppose 5 people are selected at random.19 What is the probability that all are right-handed What is the probability that all are left-handed What is the probability that not all of the people are right-handed Suppose the variables handedness and gender are independent, i.e. knowing someone’s gender provides no useful information about their handedness and vice-versa. Then we can compute whether a randomly selected person is right-handed and female20 using the Multiplication Rule: \\[\\begin{aligned} P(\\text{right-handed and female}) &amp;=&amp; P(\\text{right-handed}) \\times P(\\text{female}) \\\\ &amp;=&amp; 0.91 \\times 0.50 = 0.455\\end{aligned}\\] Guided Practice Three people are selected at random.21 What is the probability that the first person is male and right-handed What is the probability that the first two people are male and right-handed What is the probability that the third person is female and left-handed What is the probability that the first two people are male and right-handed and the third person is female and left-handed Sometimes we wonder if one outcome provides useful information about another outcome. The question we are asking is, are the occurrences of the two events independent We say that two events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are independent if they satisfy \\[P(A \\text{ and }B) = P(A) \\times P(B)\\] Example If we shuffle up a deck of cards and draw one, is the event that the card is a heart independent of the event that the card is an ace The probability the card is a heart is \\(1/4\\) and the probability that it is an ace is \\(1/13\\). The probability the card is the ace of hearts is \\(1/52\\). We check whether \\(P(A \\text{ and }B) = P(A) \\times P(B)\\) is satisfied: \\[\\begin{aligned} P({\\color{redcards}\\heartsuit})\\times P(\\text{ace}) = \\frac{1}{4}\\times \\frac{1}{13} = \\frac{1}{52} = P({\\color{redcards}\\heartsuit}\\text{ and ace})\\end{aligned}\\] Because the equation holds, the event that the card is a heart and the event that the card is an ace are independent events. 10.2 Conditional probability Are students more likely to use marijuana when their parents used drugs The data set contains a sample of 445 cases with two variables, students and parents, and is summarized in the table below.22 The variable is either uses or not, where a student is labeled as if she has recently used marijuana. The student variable takes the value used if at least one of the parents used drugs, including alcohol. Contingency table summarizing the data set. used not Total uses 125 94 219 not 85 141 226 Total 210 235 445 A Venn diagram using boxes for the data set. Example If at least one parent used drugs, what is the chance their child () uses We will estimate this probability using the data. Of the 210 cases in this data set where = used, 125 represent cases where = uses: \\[\\begin{aligned} P(\\text{student = uses given parents = used}) = \\frac{125}{210} = 0.60\\end{aligned}\\] Example A student is randomly selected from the study and she does not use drugs. What is the probability that at least one of her parents used If the student does not use drugs, then she is one of the 226 students in the second row. Of these 226 students, 85 had at least one parent who used drugs: \\[\\begin{aligned} P(\\text{parents = used given student = not}) = \\frac{85}{226} = 0.376\\end{aligned}\\] 10.2.1 Marginal and joint probabilities The Table below includes row and column totals for each variable separately in the data set. These totals represent marginal probabilities for the sample, which are the probabilities based on a single variable without conditioning on any other variables. For instance, a probability based solely on the variable is a marginal probability: \\[\\begin{aligned} P(\\text{student = uses}) = \\frac{219}{445} = 0.492\\end{aligned}\\] A probability of outcomes for two or more variables or processes is called a joint probability: \\[\\begin{aligned} P(\\text{student = uses and parents = not}) = \\frac{94}{445} = 0.21\\end{aligned}\\] It is common to substitute a comma for “and” in a joint probability, although either is acceptable. Probability table summarizing parental and student drug use. : used : not Total : uses 0.28 0.21 0.49 : not 0.19 0.32 0.51 Total 0.47 0.53 1.00 Marginal and joint Probabilities If a probability is based on a single variable, it is a marginal probability. The probability of outcomes for two or more variables or processes is called a joint probability. We use table proportions to summarize joint probabilities for the sample. These proportions are computed by dividing each count in the first table by 445 to obtain the proportions in the second table. The joint probability distribution of the and variables is shown in the table below. A joint probability distribution for the data set. Joint outcome Probability = used, = uses 0.28 = used, = not 0.19 = not, = uses 0.21 = not, = not 0.32 Total 1.00 Guided Practice Verify that the table above represents a probability distribution: events are disjoint, all probabilities are non-negative, and the probabilities sum to 1.23 We can compute marginal probabilities using joint probabilities in simple cases. For example, the probability a random student from the study uses drugs is found by summing the outcomes from the table above where = uses: \\[\\begin{aligned} &amp;&amp;P(\\text{student = uses}) \\\\ &amp;&amp; \\quad = P(\\text{parents = used, student = uses}) + \\\\ &amp;&amp; \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad P(\\text{parents = not, student = uses}) \\\\ &amp;&amp; \\quad = 0.28 + 0.21 = 0.49\\end{aligned}\\] 10.2.2 Defining conditional probability There is some connection between drug use of parents and of the student: drug use of one is associated with drug use of the other.24 In this section, we discuss how to use information about associations between two variables to improve probability estimation. The probability that a random student from the study uses drugs is 0.49. Could we update this probability if we knew that this student’s parents used drugs Absolutely. To do so, we limit our view to only those 210 cases where parents used drugs and look at the fraction where the student uses drugs: \\[\\begin{aligned} P(\\text{student = uses given parents = used}) = \\frac{125}{210} = 0.60\\end{aligned}\\] We call this a conditional probability because we computed the probability under a condition: = used. There are two parts to a conditional probability, the outcome of interest and the condition . It is useful to think of the condition as information we know to be true, and this information usually can be described as a known outcome or event. We separate the text inside our probability notation into the outcome of interest and the condition: \\[\\begin{aligned} &amp;&amp; P(\\text{student = uses given parents = used}) \\notag \\\\ &amp;&amp; = P(\\text{student = uses } | \\text{ parents = used}) = \\frac{125}{210} = 0.60 \\label{probStudentUsedIfParentsUsedInFormalNotation}\\end{aligned}\\] The vertical bar “\\(|\\)” is read as given. In the Equation above, we computed the probability a student uses based on the condition that at least one parent used as a fraction: \\[\\begin{aligned} &amp;&amp; P(\\text{student = uses } | \\text{ parents = used}) \\notag \\\\ &amp;&amp;\\quad = \\frac{\\text{#times student = uses and parents = used}}{\\text{#times parents = used}} \\label{ratioOfBothToRatioOfConditionalForParentsAndStudent} \\\\ &amp;&amp;\\quad = \\frac{125}{210} = 0.60 \\notag\\end{aligned}\\] We considered only those cases that met the condition, = used, and then we computed the ratio of those cases that satisfied our outcome of interest, the student uses. Counts are not always available for data, and instead only marginal and joint probabilities may be provided. For example, disease rates are commonly listed in percentages rather than in a count format. We would like to be able to compute conditional probabilities even when no counts are available, and we use the equation above as an example demonstrating this technique. We considered only those cases that satisfied the condition, = used. Of these cases, the conditional probability was the fraction who represented the outcome of interest, = uses. Suppose we were provided only the information in the second table of this section i.e. only probability data. Then if we took a sample of 1000 people, we would anticipate about 47% or \\(0.47\\times 1000 = 470\\) would meet our information criterion. Similarly, we would expect about 28% or \\(0.28\\times 1000 = 280\\) to meet both the information criterion and represent our outcome of interest. Thus, the conditional probability could be computed: \\[\\begin{aligned} P(\\text{student = uses } | \\text{ parents = used}) &amp;= \\frac{\\text{#(student = uses and parents = used)}}{\\text{#(parents = used)}} \\notag \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{280}{470} = \\frac{0.28}{0.47} = 0.60 \\label{stUserPUsedHypSampSize}\\end{aligned}\\] In In the equation above, we examine exactly the fraction of two probabilities, 0.28 and 0.47, which we can write as \\[\\begin{aligned} P(student = uses\\ \\text{and}\\ parents = used) \\quad\\text{and}\\quad P(parents = used).\\end{aligned}\\] The fraction of these probabilities represents our general formula for conditional probability. Conditional Probability The conditional probability of the outcome of interest \\(A\\) given condition \\(B\\) is computed as the following: \\[\\begin{aligned} P(A | B) = \\frac{P(A\\text{ and }B)}{P(B)} \\label{condProbEq}\\end{aligned}\\] Guided Practice Write out the following statement in conditional probability notation: “The probability a random case has = not* if it is known that = *not**“. Notice that the condition is now based on the student, not the parent. Determine the probability from part (a). The Probability table summarizing parental and student drug use. may be helpful.25 Determine the probability that one of the parents had used drugs if it is known the student does not use drugs. Using the answers from part (b) and (c), compute \\[\\begin{aligned} P(\\text{parents = used}|\\text{student = not}) + P(\\text{parents = not}|\\text{student = not})\\end{aligned}\\] Provide an intuitive argument to explain why the sum in (b) is 1.26 The data indicate that drug use of parents and children are associated. Does this mean the drug use of parents causes the drug use of the students 27 10.2.3 Smallpox in Boston, 1721 The data set provides a sample of 6,224 individuals from the year 1721 who were exposed to smallpox in Boston.28 Doctors at the time believed that inoculation, which involves exposing a person to the disease in a controlled form, could reduce the likelihood of death. Each case represents one person with two variables: innoculated and result . The variable takes two levels: yes or no, indicating whether the person was inoculated or not. The variable has outcomes lived or died. These data are summarized in the tables below. Contingency table for the data set. yes no Total lived 238 5136 5374 died 6 844 850 Total 244 5980 6224 Table proportions for the data, computed by dividing each count by the table total, 6224. yes no Total lived 0.0382 0.8252 0.8634 died 0.0010 0.1356 0.1366 Total 0.0392 0.9608 1.0000 : Table proportions for the data, computed by dividing each count by the table total, 6224. Guided Practice Write out, in formal notation, the probability a randomly selected person who was not inoculated died from smallpox, and find this probability.29 Guided Practice Determine the probability that an inoculated person died from smallpox. How does this result compare with the result of the Guided Practice above 30 Guided Practice The people of Boston self-selected whether or not to be inoculated. (a) Is this study observational or was this an experiment Can we infer any causal connection using these data What are some potential confounding variables that might influence whether someone lived or died and also affect whether that person was inoculated 31 10.2.4 General multiplication rule Section 1.1.6 introduced the Multiplication Rule for independent processes. Here we provide the General Multiplication rule for events that might not be independent. General Multiplication Rule If \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) represent two outcomes or events, then \\[\\begin{aligned} P(A\\text{ and }B) = P(A | B)\\times P(B)\\end{aligned}\\] It is useful to think of \\(A\\) as the outcome of interest and \\(B\\) as the condition. This General Multiplication Rule is simply a rearrangement of the definition for conditional probability. Example Consider the smallpox data set. Suppose we are given only two pieces of information: 96.08% of residents were not inoculated, and 85.88% of the residents who were not inoculated ended up surviving. How could we compute the probability that a resident was not inoculated and lived We will compute our answer using the General Multiplication Rule and then verify it using the smallpox probability table. We want to determine \\[\\begin{aligned} P(\\text{result = lived and inoculated = no})\\end{aligned}\\] and we are given that \\[\\begin{aligned} P(\\text{result = lived }|\\text{ inoculated = no})=0.8588 \\\\ P(\\text{inoculated = no})=0.9608\\end{aligned}\\] Among the 96.08% of people who were not inoculated, 85.88% survived: \\[\\begin{aligned} P(\\text{result = lived and inoculated = no}) = 0.8588\\times 0.9608 = 0.8251\\end{aligned}\\] This is equivalent to the General Multiplication Rule. We can confirm this probability in the smallpox probability table at the intersection of no and lived (with a small rounding error). Guided Practice Use \\(P(\\) = yes\\() = 0.0392\\) and \\(P(\\) = lived \\(|\\) = yes\\() = 0.9754\\) to determine the probability that a person was both inoculated and lived.32 Guided Practice If 97.45% of the people who were inoculated lived, what proportion of inoculated people must have died 33 Sum of conditional probabilities Let \\(A_1\\), ..., \\(A_k\\) represent all the disjoint outcomes for a variable or process. Then if \\(B\\) is an event, possibly for another variable or process, we have: \\[\\begin{aligned} P(A_1|B)+\\cdots+P(A_k|B) = 1\\end{aligned}\\] The rule for complements also holds when an event and its complement are conditioned on the same information: \\[\\begin{aligned} P(A | B) = 1 - P(A^c | B)\\end{aligned}\\] Guided Practice Based on the probabilities computed above, does it appear that inoculation is effective at reducing the risk of death from smallpox 34 10.2.5 Independence considerations in conditional probability If two processes are independent, then knowing the outcome of one should provide no information about the other. We can show this is mathematically true using conditional probabilities. Guided Practice Let \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) represent the outcomes of rolling two dice. What is the probability that the first die, \\(X\\), is 1 What is the probability that both \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are 1 Use the formula for conditional probability to compute \\(P(Y =\\) 1 \\(| X =\\) 1\\()\\). What is \\(P(Y=1)\\) Is this different from the answer from part (c) Explain.35 We can show in the Guided Practice (c) that the conditioning information has no influence by using the Multiplication Rule for independence processes: \\[\\begin{aligned} P(Y=\\text{1}|X=\\text{1}) &amp;=&amp; \\frac{P(Y=\\text{1 and }X=\\text{1})}{P(X=\\text{1})} \\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\frac{P(Y=\\text{1})\\times \\color{oiGB}P(X=\\text{1})}{\\color{oiGB}P(X=\\text{1})} \\\\ &amp;=&amp; P(Y=\\text{1}) \\\\\\end{aligned}\\] Guided Practice Ron is watching a roulette table in a casino and notices that the last five outcomes were black. He figures that the chances of getting black six times in a row is very small (about \\(1/64\\)) and puts his paycheck on red. What is wrong with his reasoning 36 10.2.6 Tree diagrams Tree diagrams are a tool to organize outcomes and probabilities around the structure of the data. They are most useful when two or more processes occur in a sequence and each process is conditioned on its predecessors. The data fit this description. We see the population as split by : yes and no. Following this split, survival rates were observed for each group. This structure is reflected in the *tree diagram shown in Figure 1.9. The first branch for is said to be the primary branch while the other branches are secondary** . A tree diagram of the data set. Tree diagrams are annotated with marginal and conditional probabilities, as shown in Figure 1.9. This tree diagram splits the smallpox data by innoculation into the yes and no groups with respective marginal probabilities 0.0392 and 0.9608. The secondary branches are conditioned on the first, so we assign conditional probabilities to these branches. For example, the top branch in Figure 1.9 is the probability that result = lived conditioned on the information that innoculated = yes. We may (and usually do) construct joint probabilities at the end of each branch in our tree by multiplying the numbers we come across as we move from left to right. These joint probabilities are computed using the General Multiplication Rule: \\[\\begin{aligned} &amp;&amp; P(\\text{inoculated = yes and result = lived}) \\\\ &amp;&amp;\\quad = P(\\text{inoculated = yes})\\times P(\\text{result = lived}|\\text{inoculated = yes}) \\\\ &amp;&amp;\\quad = 0.0392\\times 0.9754=0.0382\\end{aligned}\\] Example Consider the midterm and final for a statistics class. Suppose 13% of students earned an A on the midterm. Of those students who earned an A on the midterm, 47% received an A on the final, and 11% of the students who earned lower than an A on the midterm received an A on the final. You randomly pick up a final exam and notice the student received an A. What is the probability that this student earned an A on the midterm The end-goal is to find \\(P(\\text{midterm = A} | \\text{final = A})\\). To calculate this conditional probability, we need the following probabilities: \\[\\begin{aligned} P(\\text{midterm = A and final = A}) \\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad P(\\text{final = A})\\end{aligned}\\] However, this information is not provided, and it is not obvious how to calculate these probabilities. Since we aren’t sure how to proceed, it is useful to organize the information into a tree diagram, as shown in Figure 1.10. When constructing a tree diagram, variables provided with marginal probabilities are often used to create the tree’s primary branches; in this case, the marginal probabilities are provided for midterm grades. The final grades, which correspond to the conditional probabilities provided, will be shown on the secondary branches. A tree diagram describing the and variables. With the tree diagram constructed, we may compute the required probabilities: \\[\\begin{aligned} &amp;&amp;P(\\text{midterm = A and final = A}) = 0.0611 \\\\ &amp;&amp;P(\\text{final = A}) \\\\ &amp;&amp; \\quad= P(\\text{midterm = other and final = A}) + P(\\text{midterm = A and final = A}) \\\\ &amp;&amp; \\quad= 0.0611 + 0.0957 = 0.1568\\end{aligned}\\] The marginal probability, \\(P(\\) = A\\()\\), was calculated by adding up all the joint probabilities on the right side of the tree that correspond to = A. We may now finally take the ratio of the two probabilities: \\[\\begin{aligned} P(\\text{midterm = A} | \\text{final = A}) &amp;=&amp; \\frac{P(\\text{midterm = A and final = A})}{P(\\text{final = A})} \\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\frac{0.0611}{0.1568} = 0.3897\\end{aligned}\\] The probability the student also earned an A on the midterm is about 0.39. Guided Practice After an introductory statistics course, 78% of students can successfully construct tree diagrams. Of those who can construct tree diagrams, 97% passed, while only 57% of those students who could not construct tree diagrams passed. Organize this information into a tree diagram. What is the probability that a randomly selected student passed Compute the probability a student is able to construct a tree diagram if it is known that she passed.37 10.3 Random variables Example Two books are assigned for a statistics class: a textbook and its corresponding study guide. The university bookstore determined 20% of enrolled students do not buy either book, 55% buy the textbook only, and 25% buy both books, and these percentages are relatively constant from one term to another. If there are 100 students enrolled, how many books should the bookstore expect to sell to this class Guided Practice Around 20 students will not buy either book (0 books total), about 55 will buy one book (55 books total), and approximately 25 will buy two books (totaling 50 books for these 25 students). The bookstore should expect to sell about 105 books for this class. Example Would you be surprised if the bookstore sold slightly more or less than 105 books 38 The textbook costs $137 and the study guide $33. How much revenue should the bookstore expect from this class of 100 students About 55 students will just buy a textbook, providing revenue of \\[\\begin{aligned} \\$137 \\times 55 = \\$7,535\\end{aligned}\\] The roughly 25 students who buy both the textbook and the study guide would pay a total of \\[\\begin{aligned} (\\$137 + \\$33) \\times 25 = \\$170 \\times 25 = \\$4,250\\end{aligned}\\] Thus, the bookstore should expect to generate about \\(\\$7,535 + \\$4,250 = \\$11,785\\) from these 100 students for this one class. However, there might be some sampling variability so the actual amount may differ by a little bit. Probability distribution for the bookstore’s revenue from a single student. The distribution balances on a triangle representing the average revenue per student. Example What is the average revenue per student for this course The expected total revenue is $11,785, and there are 100 students. Therefore the expected revenue per student is \\(\\$11,785/100 = \\$117.85\\). 10.3.1 Expectation We call a variable or process with a numerical outcome a , and we usually represent this random variable with a capital letter such as \\(X\\), \\(Y\\), or \\(Z\\). The amount of money a single student will spend on her statistics books is a random variable, and we represent it by \\(X\\). Random Variable &gt; A random process or variable with a numerical outcome. The possible outcomes of \\(X\\) are labeled with a corresponding lower case letter \\(x\\) and subscripts. For example, we write \\(x_1=\\$0\\), \\(x_2=\\$137\\), and \\(x_3=\\$170\\), which occur with probabilities \\(0.20\\), \\(0.55\\), and \\(0.25\\). The distribution of \\(X\\) is summarized in Figure 1.11 and the table below The probability distribution for the random variable \\(X\\), representing the bookstore’s revenue from a single student. \\(i\\) 1 2 3 Total \\(x_i\\) $0 $137 $170 – \\(P(X=x_i)\\) 0.20 0.55 0.25 1.00 We computed the average outcome of \\(X\\) as $117.85 in dealing with the revenue per student. We call this average the expected value of \\(X\\), denoted by \\(E(X)\\). The expected value of a random variable is computed by adding each outcome weighted by its probability: \\[\\begin{aligned} E(X) &amp;= 0 \\times P(X=0) + 137 \\times P(X=137) + 170 \\times P(X=170) \\\\ &amp;= 0 \\times 0.20 + 137 \\times 0.55 + 170 \\times 0.25 = 117.85\\end{aligned}\\] Expected value of a Discrete Random Variable If \\(X\\) takes outcomes \\(x_1\\), ..., \\(x_k\\) with probabilities \\(P(X=x_1)\\), ..., \\(P(X=x_k)\\), the expected value of \\(X\\) is the sum of each outcome multiplied by its corresponding probability: \\[\\begin{aligned} E(X) &amp;= x_1\\times P(X=x_1) + \\cdots + x_k\\times P(X=x_k) \\notag \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{i=1}^{k}x_iP(X=x_i)\\end{aligned}\\] The Greek letter \\(\\mu\\) may be used in place of the notation \\(E(X)\\). The expected value for a random variable represents the average outcome. For example, \\(E(X)=117.85\\) represents the average amount the bookstore expects to make from a single student, which we could also write as \\(\\mu=117.85\\). It is also possible to compute the expected value of a continuous random variable. However, it requires a little calculus and we save it for a later class.39 In physics, the expectation holds the same meaning as the center of gravity. The distribution can be represented by a series of weights at each outcome, and the mean represents the balancing point. This is represented in Figures 1.11 and 1.12. The idea of a center of gravity also expands to continuous probability distributions. Figure 1.13 shows a continuous probability distribution balanced atop a wedge placed at the mean. A weight system representing the probability distribution for \\(X\\). The string holds the distribution at the mean to keep the system balanced. A continuous distribution can also be balanced at its mean. 10.3.2 Variability in random variables Suppose you ran the university bookstore. Besides how much revenue you expect to generate, you might also want to know the volatility (variability) in your revenue. The and can be used to describe the variability of a random variable. We first computed deviations from the mean (\\(x_i - \\mu\\)), squared those deviations, and took an average to get the variance. In the case of a random variable, we again compute squared deviations. However, we take their sum weighted by their corresponding probabilities, just like we did for the expectation. This weighted sum of squared deviations equals the variance, and we calculate the standard deviation by taking the square root of the variance. General variance formula If \\(X\\) takes outcomes \\(x_1\\), ..., \\(x_k\\) with probabilities \\(P(X=x_1)\\), ..., \\(P(X=x_k)\\) and expected value \\(\\mu=E(X)\\), then the variance of \\(X\\), denoted by \\(Var(X)\\) or the symbol \\(\\sigma^2\\), is \\[\\begin{aligned} \\sigma^2 &amp;= (x_1-\\mu)^2\\times P(X=x_1) + \\cdots \\notag \\\\ &amp; \\qquad\\quad\\cdots+ (x_k-\\mu)^2\\times P(X=x_k) \\notag \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{j=1}^{k} (x_j - \\mu)^2 P(X=x_j)\\end{aligned}\\] The standard deviation of \\(X\\), labeled \\(\\sigma\\), is the square root of the variance. Example Compute the expected value, variance, and standard deviation of \\(X\\), the revenue of a single statistics student for the bookstore. It is useful to construct a table that holds computations for each outcome separately, then add up the results. \\(i\\) 1 2 3 Total \\(x_i\\) $0 $137 $170 \\(P(X=x_i)\\) 0.20 0.55 0.25 \\(x_i \\times P(X=x_i)\\) 0 75.35 42.50 117.85 Thus, the expected value is \\(\\mu=117.85\\), which we computed earlier. The variance can be constructed by extending this table: \\(i\\) 1 2 3 Total \\(x_i\\) $0 $137 $170 \\(P(X=x_i)\\) 0.20 0.55 0.25 \\(x_i \\times P(X=x_i)\\) 0 75.35 42.50 117.85 \\(x_i - \\mu\\) -117.85 19.15 52.15 \\((x_i-\\mu)^2\\) 13888.62 366.72 2719.62 \\((x_i-\\mu)^2\\times P(X=x_i)\\) 2777.7 201.7 679.9 3659.3 The variance of \\(X\\) is \\(\\sigma^2 = 3659.3\\), which means the standard deviation is \\(\\sigma = \\sqrt{3659.3} = \\$60.49\\). Guided Practice The bookstore also offers a chemistry textbook for $159 and a book supplement for $41. From past experience, they know about 25% of chemistry students just buy the textbook while 60% buy both the textbook and supplement.40 What proportion of students don’t buy either book Assume no students buy the supplement without the textbook. Let \\(Y\\) represent the revenue from a single student. Write out the probability distribution of \\(Y\\), i.e. a table for each outcome and its associated probability. Compute the expected revenue from a single chemistry student. Find the standard deviation to describe the variability associated with the revenue from a single student. 10.3.3 Linear combinations of random variables So far, we have thought of each variable as being a complete story in and of itself. Sometimes it is more appropriate to use a combination of variables. For instance, the amount of time a person spends commuting to work each week can be broken down into several daily commutes. Similarly, the total gain or loss in a stock portfolio is the sum of the gains and losses in its components. Example John travels to work five days a week. We will use \\(X_1\\) to represent his travel time on Monday, \\(X_2\\) to represent his travel time on Tuesday, and so on. Write an equation using \\(X_1\\), ..., \\(X_5\\) that represents his travel time for the week, denoted by \\(W\\). His total weekly travel time is the sum of the five daily values: \\[W = X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4 + X_5\\] Breaking the weekly travel time \\(W\\) into pieces provides a framework for understanding each source of randomness and is useful for modeling \\(W\\). Example It takes John an average of 18 minutes each day to commute to work. What would you expect his average commute time to be for the week We were told that the average (i.e. expected value) of the commute time is 18 minutes per day: \\(E(X_i) = 18\\). To get the expected time for the sum of the five days, we can add up the expected time for each individual day: \\[\\begin{aligned} E(W) &amp;= E(X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4 + X_5) \\\\ &amp;= E(X_1) + E(X_2) + E(X_3) + E(X_4) + E(X_5) \\\\ &amp;= 18 + 18 + 18 + 18 + 18 = 90\\text{ minutes}\\end{aligned}\\] The expectation of the total time is equal to the sum of the expected individual times. More generally, the expectation of a sum of random variables is always the sum of the expectation for each random variable. Guided Practice Elena is selling a TV at a cash auction and also intends to buy a toaster oven in the auction. If \\(X\\) represents the profit for selling the TV and \\(Y\\) represents the cost of the toaster oven, write an equation that represents the net change in Elena’s cash.41 Based on past auctions, Elena figures she should expect to make about $175 on the TV and pay about $23 for the toaster oven. In total, how much should she expect to make or spend 42 Guided Practice Would you be surprised if John’s weekly commute wasn’t exactly 90 minutes or if Elena didn’t make exactly $152 Explain.43 Two important concepts concerning combinations of random variables have so far been introduced. First, a final value can sometimes be described as the sum of its parts in an equation. Second, intuition suggests that putting the individual average values into this equation gives the average value we would expect in total. This second point needs clarification – it is guaranteed to be true in what are called linear combinations of random variables. A Linear Combination of two random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is a fancy phrase to describe a combination \\[aX + bY\\] where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are some fixed and known numbers. For John’s commute time, there were five random variables – one for each work day – and each random variable could be written as having a fixed coefficient of 1: \\[1X_1 + 1 X_2 + 1 X_3 + 1 X_4 + 1 X_5\\] For Elena’s net gain or loss, the \\(X\\) random variable had a coefficient of +1 and the \\(Y\\) random variable had a coefficient of -1. When considering the average of a linear combination of random variables, it is safe to plug in the mean of each random variable and then compute the final result. For a few examples of nonlinear combinations of random variables – cases where we cannot simply plug in the means – see the footnote.44 Linear combinations of random variables and the average result If \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are random variables, then a linear combination of the random variables is given by \\[\\begin{aligned} \\label{linComboOfRandomVariablesXAndY} aX + bY\\end{aligned}\\] where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are some fixed numbers. To compute the average value of a linear combination of random variables, plug in the average of each individual random variable and compute the result: \\[\\begin{aligned} a\\times E(X) + b\\times E(Y)\\end{aligned}\\] Recall that the expected value is the same as the mean, e.g. \\(E(X) = \\mu_X\\). Example Leonard has invested $6000 in Google Inc. (stock ticker: GOOG) and $2000 in Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM). If \\(X\\) represents the change in Google’s stock next month and \\(Y\\) represents the change in Exxon Mobil stock next month, write an equation that describes how much money will be made or lost in Leonard’s stocks for the month. For simplicity, we will suppose \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are not in percents but are in decimal form (e.g. if Google’s stock increases 1%, then \\(X=0.01\\); or if it loses 1%, then \\(X=-0.01\\)). Then we can write an equation for Leonard’s gain as \\[\\begin{aligned} \\$6000\\times X + \\$2000\\times Y\\end{aligned}\\] If we plug in the change in the stock value for \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), this equation gives the change in value of Leonard’s stock portfolio for the month. A positive value represents a gain, and a negative value represents a loss. Guided Practice Suppose Google and Exxon Mobil stocks have recently been rising 2.1% and 0.4% per month, respectively. Compute the expected change in Leonard’s stock portfolio for next month.45 Guided Practice You should have found that Leonard expects a positive gain. However, would you be surprised if he actually had a loss this month 46 10.3.4 Variability in linear combinations of random variables Quantifying the average outcome from a linear combination of random variables is helpful, but it is also important to have some sense of the uncertainty associated with the total outcome of that combination of random variables. We calculated the expected net gain or loss of Leonard’s stock portfolio was considered in Guided Practice. However, there was no quantitative discussion of the volatility of this portfolio. For instance, while the average monthly gain might be about $134 according to the data, that gain is not guaranteed. Figure 1.14 shows the monthly changes in a portfolio like Leonard’s during the 36 months from 2009 to 2011. The gains and losses vary widely, and quantifying these fluctuations is important when investing in stocks. The change in a portfolio like Leonard’s for the 36 months from 2009 to 2011, where $6000 is in Google’s stock and $2000 is in Exxon Mobil’s. Just as we have done in many previous cases, we use the variance and standard deviation to describe the uncertainty associated with Leonard’s monthly returns. To do so, the variances of each stock’s monthly return will be useful, and these are shown in the table below. The stocks’ returns are nearly independent. The mean, standard deviation, and variance of the GOOG and XOM stocks. These statistics were estimated from historical stock data, so notation used for sample statistics has been used. Mean (\\(\\bar{x}\\)) Standard deviation (\\(s\\)) Variance (\\(s^2\\)) GOOG 0.0210 0.0846 0.0072 XOM 0.0038 0.0519 0.0027 Here we use an equation from probability theory to describe the uncertainty of Leonard’s monthly returns; we leave the proof of this method to a dedicated probability course. The variance of a linear combination of random variables can be computed by plugging in the variances of the individual random variables and squaring the coefficients of the random variables: \\[\\begin{aligned} Var(aX + bY) = a^2\\times Var(X) + b^2\\times Var(Y)\\end{aligned}\\] It is important to note that this equality assumes the random variables are independent; if independence doesn’t hold, then more advanced methods are necessary. This equation can be used to compute the variance of Leonard’s monthly return: \\[\\begin{aligned} Var(6000\\times X + 2000\\times Y) &amp;= 6000^2\\times Var(X) + 2000^2\\times Var(Y) \\\\ &amp;= 36,000,000\\times 0.0072 + 4,000,000\\times 0.0027 \\\\ &amp;= 270,000\\end{aligned}\\] The standard deviation is computed as the square root of the variance: \\(\\sqrt{270,000} = \\$520\\). While an average monthly return of $134 on an $8000 investment is nothing to scoff at, the monthly returns are so volatile that Leonard should not expect this income to be very stable. Variability of linear combinations of random variables The variance of a linear combination of random variables may be computed by squaring the constants, substituting in the variances for the random variables, and computing the result: \\[\\begin{aligned} Var(aX + bY) = a^2\\times Var(X) + b^2\\times Var(Y)\\end{aligned}\\] This equation is valid as long as the random variables are independent of each other. The standard deviation of the linear combination may be found by taking the square root of the variance. Example Suppose John’s daily commute has a standard deviation of 4 minutes. What is the uncertainty in his total commute time for the week The expression for John’s commute time was \\[\\begin{aligned} X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4 + X_5\\end{aligned}\\] Each coefficient is 1, and the variance of each day’s time is \\(4^2=16\\). Thus, the variance of the total weekly commute time is \\[\\begin{aligned} &amp;\\text{variance }= 1^2 \\times 16 + 1^2 \\times 16 + 1^2 \\times 16 + 1^2 \\times 16 + 1^2 \\times 16 = 5\\times 16 = 80 \\\\ &amp;\\text{standard deviation } = \\sqrt{\\text{variance}} = \\sqrt{80} = 8.94\\end{aligned}\\] The standard deviation for John’s weekly work commute time is about 9 minutes. Guided Practice The computation in the example above relied on an important assumption: the commute time for each day is independent of the time on other days of that week. Do you think this is valid Explain.47 Guided Practice Elena is selling a TV at a cash auction and also intends to buy a toaster oven in the auction. If \\(X\\) represents the profit for selling the TV and \\(Y\\) represents the cost of the toaster oven. Suppose these auctions are approximately independent and the variability in auction prices associated with the TV and toaster oven can be described using standard deviations of $25 and $8. Compute the standard deviation of Elena’s net gain.48 The negative coefficient for \\(Y\\) in the linear combination was eliminated when we squared the coefficients. This generally holds true: negatives in a linear combination will have no impact on the variability computed for a linear combination, but they do impact the expected value computations. Here are four examples. (i) Whether someone gets sick in the next month or not is an apparently random process with outcomes sick and not. (ii) We can generate a random process by randomly picking a person and measuring that person’s height. The outcome of this process will be a positive number. (iii) Whether the stock market goes up or down next week is a seemingly random process with possible outcomes up, down, and no_change. Alternatively, we could have used the percent change in the stock market as a numerical outcome. (iv) Whether your roommate cleans her dishes tonight probably seems like a random process with possible outcomes cleans_dishes and leaves_dishes.↩ () The random process is a die roll, and at most one of these outcomes can come up. This means they are disjoint outcomes. (b) \\(P(\\)1 or 4 or 5\\() = P(\\)1\\()+P(\\)4\\()+P(\\)5\\() = \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\\)↩ Since \\(B\\) and \\(D\\) are disjoint events, use the Addition Rule: \\(P(B\\) or \\(D) = P(B) + P(D) = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}\\).↩ The 52 cards are split into four : \\(\\clubsuit\\) (club), \\(\\diamondsuit\\) (diamond), \\(\\heartsuit\\) (heart), \\(\\spadesuit\\) (spade). Each suit has its 13 cards labeled: 2, 3, ..., 10, J (jack), Q (queen), K (king), and A (ace). Thus, each card is a unique combination of a suit and a label, e.g. 4\\(\\heartsuit\\) and J\\(\\clubsuit\\). The 12 cards represented by the jacks, queens, and kings are called . The cards that are \\(\\diamondsuit\\) or \\(\\heartsuit\\) are typically colored red while the other two suits are typically colored black.↩ The Venn diagram shows face cards split up into “face card but not \\(\\diamondsuit\\)” and “face card and \\(\\diamondsuit\\)”. Since these correspond to disjoint events, \\(P(\\)face card\\()\\) is found by adding the two corresponding probabilities: \\(\\frac{3}{52} + \\frac{9}{52} = \\frac{12}{52} = \\frac{3}{13}\\).↩ The probabilities of (a) do not sum to 1. The second probability in (b) is negative. This leaves (c), which sure enough satisfies the requirements of a distribution. One of the three was said to be the actual distribution of US household incomes, so it must be (c).↩ It is also possible to construct a distribution plot when income is not artificially binned into four groups.↩ Brief solutions: (a) \\(A^c=\\{\\)3, 4, 5, 6\\(\\}\\) and \\(B^c=\\{\\)1, 2, 3, 5\\(\\}\\). (b) Noting that each outcome is disjoint, add the individual outcome probabilities to get \\(P(A^c)=2/3\\) and \\(P(B^c)=2/3\\). (c) \\(A\\) and \\(A^c\\) are disjoint, and the same is true of \\(B\\) and \\(B^c\\). Therefore, \\(P(A) + P(A^c) = 1\\) and \\(P(B) + P(B^c) = 1\\).↩ The actual proportion of the U.S. population that is female is about 50%, and so we use 0.5 for the probability of sampling a woman. However, this probability does differ in other countries.↩ Brief answers are provided. (a) This can be written in probability notation as \\(P(\\)a randomly selected person is male and right-handed\\()=0.455\\). (b) 0.207. (c) 0.045. (d) 0.0093.↩ Ellis GJ and Stone LH. 1979.

(b) No, we cannot infer causation from this observational study. (c) Accessibility to the latest and best medical care. There are other valid answers for part (c).↩ The answer is 0.0382.↩ There were only two possible outcomes: lived or died. This means that 100% - 97.45% = 2.55% of the people who were inoculated died.↩ The samples are large relative to the difference in death rates for the “inoculated” and “not inoculated” groups, so it seems there is an association between and . However, as noted in the solution to Guided Practice, this is an observational study and we cannot be sure if there is a causal connection. (Further research has shown that inoculation is effective at reducing death rates.)↩ Brief solutions: (a) \\(1/6\\). (b) \\(1/36\\). (c) \\(\\frac{P(Y = \\text{ 1 and }X=\\text{ 1})}{P(X=\\text{ 1})} = \\frac{1/36}{1/6} = 1/6\\). (d) The probability is the same as in part (c): \\(P(Y=1)=1/6\\). The probability that \\(Y=1\\) was unchanged by knowledge about \\(X\\), which makes sense as \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent.↩ He has forgotten that the next roulette spin is independent of the previous spins.

For example, the traffic will vary from one day to next, and auction prices will vary depending on the quality of the merchandise and the interest of the attendees.↩ If \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are random variables, consider the following combinations: \\(X^{1+Y}\\), \\(X\\times Y\\), \\(X/Y\\). In such cases, plugging in the average value for each random variable and computing the result will not generally lead to an accurate average value for the end result.↩ \\(E(\\$6000\\times X + \\$2000\\times Y) = \\$6000\\times 0.021 + \\$2000\\times 0.004 = \\$134\\).↩ No. While stocks tend to rise over time, they are often volatile in the short term.↩ One concern is whether traffic patterns tend to have a weekly cycle (e.g. Fridays may be worse than other days). If that is the case, and John drives, then the assumption is probably not reasonable. However, if John walks to work, then his commute is probably not affected by any weekly traffic cycle.↩ "]
