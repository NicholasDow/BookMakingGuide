<p>Probability forms a foundation for statistics. You might already be familiar with many aspects of probability, however, formalization of the concepts is new for most. This chapter aims to introduce probability on familiar terms using processes most people have seen before.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">10.1.1</span> Intro Questions</h3>
<p><strong>Q1</strong>: A “die”, the singular of dice, is a cube with six faces numbered <em>1</em>, <em>2</em>, <em>3</em>, <em>4</em>, <em>5</em>, and <em>6</em>. What is the chance of getting <em>1</em> when rolling a die</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>S1</strong>: If the die is fair, then the chance of a <em>1</em> is as good as the chance of any other number. Since there are six outcomes, the chance must be 1-in-6 or, equivalently, <span class="math inline">\(1/6\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Q2</strong>: What is the chance of getting a <em>1</em> or <em>2</em> in the next roll</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>S2</strong>: <em>1</em> and <em>2</em> constitute two of the six equally likely possible outcomes, so the chance of getting one of these two outcomes must be <span class="math inline">\(2/6 = 1/3\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Q3</strong>: What is the chance of getting either <em>1</em>, <em>2</em>, <em>3</em>, <em>4</em>, <em>5</em>, or <em>6</em> on the next roll</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>S3</strong>: 100%. The outcome must be one of these numbers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Q4</strong>: What is the chance of not rolling a <em>2</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>S4</strong>: Since the chance of rolling a <em>2</em> is <span class="math inline">\(1/6\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(16.\bar{6}\%\)</span>, the chance of not rolling a <em>2</em> must be <span class="math inline">\(100\% - 16.\bar{6}\%=83.\bar{3}\%\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(5/6\)</span>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we could have noticed that not rolling a <em>2</em> is the same as getting a <em>1</em>, <em>3</em>, <em>4</em>, <em>5</em>, or <em>6</em>, which makes up five of the six equally likely outcomes and has probability <span class="math inline">\(5/6\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Q5</strong>: Consider rolling two dice. If <span class="math inline">\(1/6^{th}\)</span> of the time the first die is a <em>1</em> and <span class="math inline">\(1/6^{th}\)</span> of those times the second die is a <em>1</em>, what is the chance of getting two <em>1</em>s</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>S</strong>: If <span class="math inline">\(16.\bar{6}\)</span>% of the time the first die is a <em>1</em> and <span class="math inline">\(1/6^{th}\)</span> of <em>those</em> times the second die is also a <em>1</em>, then the chance that both dice are <em>1</em> is <span class="math inline">\((1/6)\times (1/6)\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(1/36\)</span>.</p>

<p>Rolling a die or flipping a coin is a seemingly random process and each gives rise to an outcome.</p>
<p><strong>Def of Probability</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>probability</strong> of an outcome is the proportion of times the outcome would occur if we observed the random process an infinite number of times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Probability is defined as a proportion, and it always takes values between 0 and 1 (inclusively). It may also be displayed as a percentage between 0% and 100%.</p>
<p>Probability can be illustrated by rolling a die many times. Let <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}_n\)</span> be the proportion of outcomes that are <em>1</em> after the first <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> rolls. As the number of rolls increases, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}_n\)</span> will converge to the probability of rolling a <em>1</em>, <span class="math inline">\(p = 1/6\)</span>. Figure <a href="probability.html#dieProp" reference-type="ref" reference="dieProp">1.1</a> shows this convergence for 100,000 die rolls. The tendency of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}_n\)</span> to stabilize around <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is described by the <strong>Law of Large Numbers</strong>.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="figures/dieProp/dieProp.png" alt="The fraction of die rolls that are 1 at each stage in a simulation. The proportion tends to get closer to the probability 1/6 \approx 0.167 as the number of rolls increases." id="dieProp" style="width:80.0%" />
<p class="caption">The fraction of die rolls that are 1 at each stage in a simulation. The proportion tends to get closer to the probability <span class="math inline">\(1/6 \approx 0.167\)</span> as the number of rolls increases.<span label="dieProp"></span></p>
</div>
<p><strong>Def of Law of Large Numbers</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As more observations are collected, the proportion <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}_n\)</span> of occurrences with a particular outcome converges to the probability <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> of that outcome.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Occasionally the proportion will veer off from the probability and appear to defy the Law of Large Numbers, as <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}_n\)</span> does many times in Figure <a href="probability.html#dieProp" reference-type="ref" reference="dieProp">1.1</a>. However, these deviations become smaller as the number of rolls increases.</p>
<p>Above we write <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> as the probability of rolling a <em>1</em>. We can also write this probability as <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
P(\text{rolling a 1})\end{aligned}\]</span> As we become more comfortable with this notation, we will abbreviate it further. For instance, if it is clear that the process is “rolling a die”, we could abbreviate <span class="math inline">\(P(\)</span>rolling a <em>1</em><span class="math inline">\()\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(P(\)</span><em>1</em><span class="math inline">\()\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Guided Practice</strong></p>
<p>Random processes include rolling a die and flipping a coin.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Think of another random process.</li>
<li>Describe all the possible outcomes of that process. For instance, rolling a die is a random process with potential outcomes <em>1</em>, <em>2</em>, ..., <em>6</em>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
</ol>
<p>What we think of as random processes are not necessarily random, but they may just be too difficult to understand exactly. The fourth example in the footnote solution to Guided Practice suggests a roommate’s behavior is a random process. However, even if a roommate’s behavior is not truly random, modeling her behavior as a random process can still be useful.</p>

<p>It can be helpful to model a process as random even if it is not truly random.</p>

<div id="disjoint-or-mutually-exclusive-outcomes" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">10.1.3</span> Disjoint or mutually exclusive outcomes</h3>
<p>Two outcomes are called <strong>disjoint</strong> or <strong>mutually exclusive</strong> if they cannot both happen. For instance, if we roll a die, the outcomes <em>1</em> and <em>2</em> are disjoint since they cannot both occur. On the other hand, the outcomes <em>1</em> and “rolling an odd number” are not disjoint since both occur if the outcome of the roll is a <em>1</em>. The terms <em>disjoint</em> and <em>mutually exclusive</em> are equivalent and interchangeable.</p>
<p>Calculating the probability of disjoint outcomes is easy. When rolling a die, the outcomes <em>1</em> and <em>2</em> are disjoint, and we compute the probability that one of these outcomes will occur by adding their separate probabilities: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
P(\text{1 or 2}) = P(\text{1})+P(\text{2}) = 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3\end{aligned}\]</span> What about the probability of rolling a <em>1</em>, <em>2</em>, <em>3</em>, <em>4</em>, <em>5</em>, or <em>6</em></p>
<p>Here again, all of the outcomes are disjoint so we add the probabilities: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
&amp;&amp;P(\text{1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6}) \\
    &amp;&amp;\quad= P(\text{1})+P(\text{2})+P(\text{3})+P(\text{4})+P(\text{5})+P(\text{6}) \\
    &amp;&amp;\quad= 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 1.\end{aligned}\]</span> The <strong>Addition Rule</strong> guarantees the accuracy of this approach when the outcomes are disjoint.</p>
<p><strong>Addition Rule of disjoint outcomes</strong></p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A_2\)</span> represent two disjoint outcomes, then the probability that one of them occurs is given by <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
P(A_1\text{ or } A_2) = P(A_1) + P(A_2)\end{aligned}\]</span> If there are many disjoint outcomes <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span>, ..., <span class="math inline">\(A_k\)</span>, then the probability that one of these outcomes will occur is <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
P(A_1) + P(A_2) + \cdots + P(A_k)\end{aligned}\]</span></p>

<p>Statisticians rarely work with individual outcomes and instead consider or of outcomes. Let <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> represent the event where a die roll results in <em>1</em> or <em>2</em> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> represent the event that the die roll is a <em>4</em> or a <em>6</em>. We write <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> as the set of outcomes <span class="math inline">\(\{\)</span><em>1</em>, <em>2</em><span class="math inline">\(\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B=\{\)</span><em>4</em>, <em>6</em><span class="math inline">\(\}\)</span>. These sets are commonly called . Because <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> have no elements in common, they are disjoint events. <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are represented in Figure <a href="probability.html#disjointSets" reference-type="ref" reference="disjointSets">1.2</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Venn diagrams</strong> are useful when outcomes can be categorized as “in” or “out” for two or three variables, attributes, or random processes. The Venn diagram in Figure <a href="probability.html#venn" reference-type="ref" reference="venn">1.3</a> uses a circle to represent diamonds and another to represent face cards. If a card is both a diamond and a face card, it falls into the intersection of the circles. If it is a diamond but not a face card, it will be in part of the left circle that is not in the right circle (and so on). The total number of cards that are diamonds is given by the total number of cards in the diamonds circle: <span class="math inline">\(10+3=13\)</span>. The probabilities are also shown (e.g. <span class="math inline">\(10/52 = 0.1923\)</span>).</p>

<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> represent the event that a randomly selected card is a diamond and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> represent the event that it is a face card.

<p>Events <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are not disjoint – the cards <span class="math inline">\(J\diamondsuit\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(Q\diamondsuit\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(K\diamondsuit\)</span> fall into both categories – so we cannot use the Addition Rule for disjoint events. Instead we use the Venn diagram. We start by adding the probabilities of the two events: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}

P(A\text{ or } B) &amp;=&amp;P(\text{face card or }{\color{redcards}\diamondsuit})  \notag \\
 &amp;=&amp; P(\text{face card}) + P({\color{redcards}\diamondsuit}) - P(\text{face card and }{\color{redcards}\diamondsuit}) \label{diamondFace} \\

<p><strong>General Addition Rule</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are any two events, disjoint or not, then the probability that at least one of them will occur is <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}

<p>When we write “or” in statistics, we mean “and/or” unless we explicitly state otherwise.

<p>Probability distributions can also be summarized in a bar plot.

<p>In these bar plots, the bar heights represent the probabilities of outcomes.

<p>A complement of an event <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is constructed to have two very important properties: (i) every possible outcome not in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is in <span class="math inline">\(A^c\)</span>, and (ii) <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A^c\)</span> are disjoint. Property (i) implies <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
P(A\text{ or }A^c) = 1
\label{complementSumTo1}\end{aligned}\]</span> That is, if the outcome is not in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, it must be represented in <span class="math inline">\(A^c\)</span>. We use the Addition Rule for disjoint events to apply Property (ii): <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
P(A\text{ or }A^c) = P(A) + P(A^c)
\label{complementDisjointEquation}\end{aligned}\]</span> Combining the Equations above yields a very useful relationship between the probability of an event and its complement.</p>
<p><strong>Complement</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The complement of event <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is denoted <span class="math inline">\(A^c\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(A^c\)</span> represents all outcomes not in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A^c\)</span> are mathematically related: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\label{complement}
 P(A) + P(A^c) = 1, \quad\text{i.e.}\quad P(A) = 1-P(A^c)\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In simple examples, computing <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(A^c\)</span> is feasible in a few steps. However, using the complement can save a lot of time as problems grow in complexity.</p>

<div id="probabilityIndependence" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">10.1.7</span> Independence</h3>
<p>Just as variables and observations can be independent, random processes can be independent, too. Two processes are <strong>independent</strong> if knowing the outcome of one provides no useful information about the outcome of the other. For instance, flipping a coin and rolling a die are two independent processes – knowing the coin was heads does not help determine the outcome of a die roll. On the other hand, stock prices usually move up or down together, so they are not independent.</p>
<p>The rolling two dice is a basic example of this. We want to determine the probability that both will be <em>1</em>. Suppose one of the dice is red and the other white. If the outcome of the red die is a <em>1</em>, it provides no information about the outcome of the white die. We first encountered this same question in in Q5 at the begining of this chapter, where we calculated the probability using the following reasoning: <span class="math inline">\(1/6^{th}\)</span> of the time the red die is a <em>1</em>, and <span class="math inline">\(1/6^{th}\)</span> of <em>those</em> times the white die will also be <em>1</em>. This is illustrated in Figure <a href="probability.html#indepForRollingTwo1s" reference-type="ref" reference="indepForRollingTwo1s">1.7</a>. Because the rolls are independent, the probabilities of the corresponding outcomes can be multiplied to get the final answer: <span class="math inline">\((1/6)\times(1/6)=1/36\)</span>. This can be generalized to many independent processes.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="figures/indepForRollingTwo1s/indepForRollingTwo1s.png" alt="1/6^{th} of the time, the first roll is a 1. Then 1/6^{th} of those times, the second roll will also be a 1." id="indepForRollingTwo1s" style="width:65.0%" />
<p class="caption"><span class="math inline">\(1/6^{th}\)</span> of the time, the first roll is a <em>1</em>. Then <span class="math inline">\(1/6^{th}\)</span> of <em>those</em> times, the second roll will also be a <em>1</em>.<span label="indepForRollingTwo1s"></span></p>
</div>
<p><strong>Example</strong> What if there was also a blue die independent of the other two?</p>
<p>What is the probability of rolling the three dice and getting all <em>1</em>s?</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(1/36^{th}\)</span> of the time the white and red dice are both <em>1</em>, then <span class="math inline">\(1/6^{th}\)</span> of <em>those</em> times the blue die will also be <em>1</em>, so multiply: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
P(white=\text{1 and } red=\text{1 and } blue=\text{1})
    &amp;= P(white=\text{1})\times P(red=\text{1})\times P(blue=\text{1}) \\
    &amp;= (1/6)\times (1/6)\times (1/6)
    = 1/216\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>The example above illustrate what is called the Multiplication Rule for independent processes.</p>
<p><strong>Multiplication Rule for independent processes</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> represent events from two different and independent processes, then the probability that both <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> occur can be calculated as the product of their separate probabilities: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\label{eqForIndependentEvents}
P(A \text{ and }B) = P(A) \times  P(B)\end{aligned}\]</span> Similarly, if there are <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> events <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span>, ..., <span class="math inline">\(A_k\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> independent processes, then the probability they all occur is <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
P(A_1) \times  P(A_2)\times  \cdots \times  P(A_k)\end{aligned}\]</span></p>

<p><strong>Guided Practice</strong></p>
<p>About 9% of people are left-handed. Suppose 2 people are selected at random from the U.S. population. Because the sample size of 2 is very small relative to the population, it is reasonable to assume these two people are independent.</p>

<p>Suppose the variables handedness and gender are independent, i.e. knowing someone’s gender provides no useful information about their handedness and vice-versa. Then we can compute whether a randomly selected person is right-handed and female<a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> using the Multiplication Rule: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
P(\text{right-handed and female}) &amp;=&amp; P(\text{right-handed}) \times  P(\text{female}) \\

<li><p>What is the probability that the first two people are male and right-handed and the third person is female and left-handed</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Sometimes we wonder if one outcome provides useful information about another outcome. The question we are asking is, are the occurrences of the two events independent</p>
<p>We say that two events <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are independent if they satisfy <span class="math display">\[P(A \text{ and }B) = P(A) \times  P(B)\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>If we shuffle up a deck of cards and draw one, is the event that the card is a heart independent of the event that the card is an ace</p>
<p>The probability the card is a heart is <span class="math inline">\(1/4\)</span> and the probability that it is an ace is <span class="math inline">\(1/13\)</span>. The probability the card is the ace of hearts is <span class="math inline">\(1/52\)</span>. We check whether <span class="math inline">\(P(A \text{ and }B) = P(A) \times P(B)\)</span> is satisfied: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
P({\color{redcards}\heartsuit})\times P(\text{ace}) = \frac{1}{4}\times \frac{1}{13} = \frac{1}{52} 
                    = P({\color{redcards}\heartsuit}\text{ and ace})\end{aligned}\]</span> Because the equation holds, the event that the card is a heart and the event that the card is an ace are independent events.</p>

&amp;&amp; = P(\text{student = uses } | \text{ parents = used}) = \frac{125}{210} = 0.60
\label{probStudentUsedIfParentsUsedInFormalNotation}\end{aligned}\]</span> The vertical bar “<span class="math inline">\(|\)</span>” is read as <em>given</em>.</p>
<p>In the Equation above, we computed the probability a student uses based on the condition that at least one parent used as a fraction: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
&amp;&amp; P(\text{student = uses } | \text{ parents = used}) \notag \\
&amp;&amp;\quad = \frac{\text{#times student = uses and parents = used}}{\text{#times parents = used}} \label{ratioOfBothToRatioOfConditionalForParentsAndStudent} \\
&amp;&amp;\quad = \frac{125}{210} = 0.60 \notag\end{aligned}\]</span> We considered only those cases that met the condition, = <em>used</em>, and then we computed the ratio of those cases that satisfied our outcome of interest, the student uses.</p>
<p>Counts are not always available for data, and instead only marginal and joint probabilities may be provided. For example, disease rates are commonly listed in percentages rather than in a count format. We would like to be able to compute conditional probabilities even when no counts are available, and we use the equation above as an example demonstrating this technique.</p>
<p>We considered only those cases that satisfied the condition, = <em>used</em>. Of these cases, the conditional probability was the fraction who represented the outcome of interest, = <em>uses</em>. Suppose we were provided only the information in the second table of this section i.e. only probability data. Then if we took a sample of 1000 people, we would anticipate about 47% or <span class="math inline">\(0.47\times 1000 = 470\)</span> would meet our information criterion. Similarly, we would expect about 28% or <span class="math inline">\(0.28\times 1000 = 280\)</span> to meet both the information criterion and represent our outcome of interest. Thus, the conditional probability could be computed: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
P(\text{student = uses } | \text{ parents = used})
    &amp;= \frac{\text{#(student = uses and parents = used)}}{\text{#(parents = used)}} \notag \\
    &amp;= \frac{280}{470} = \frac{0.28}{0.47} = 0.60
\label{stUserPUsedHypSampSize}\end{aligned}\]</span> In In the equation above, we examine exactly the fraction of two probabilities, 0.28 and 0.47, which we can write as <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
P(student = uses\ \text{and}\ parents = used)
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    P(parents = used).\end{aligned}\]</span> The fraction of these probabilities represents our general formula for conditional probability.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">10.2.4</span> General multiplication rule</h3>
<p>Section <a href="probability.html#probabilityIndependence" reference-type="ref" reference="probabilityIndependence">1.1.6</a> introduced the Multiplication Rule for independent processes. Here we provide the <strong>General Multiplication rule</strong> for events that might not be independent.</p>
<p><strong>General Multiplication Rule</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> represent two outcomes or events, then <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
P(A\text{ and }B) = P(A | B)\times P(B)\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is useful to think of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> as the outcome of interest and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> as the condition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This General Multiplication Rule is simply a rearrangement of the definition for conditional probability.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Consider the smallpox data set. Suppose we are given only two pieces of information: 96.08% of residents were not inoculated, and 85.88% of the residents who were not inoculated ended up surviving. How could we compute the probability that a resident was not inoculated and lived</p>
<p>We will compute our answer using the General Multiplication Rule and then verify it using the smallpox probability table. We want to determine <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
P(\text{result = lived and inoculated = no})\end{aligned}\]</span> and we are given that <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
P(\text{result = lived }|\text{ inoculated = no})=0.8588 \\
P(\text{inoculated = no})=0.9608\end{aligned}\]</span> Among the 96.08% of people who were not inoculated, 85.88% survived: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
P(\text{result = lived and inoculated = no}) = 0.8588\times 0.9608 = 0.8251\end{aligned}\]</span> This is equivalent to the General Multiplication Rule. We can confirm this probability in the smallpox probability table at the intersection of <em>no</em> and <em>lived</em> (with a small rounding error).</p>
<p><strong>Guided Practice</strong></p>
<p>Use <span class="math inline">\(P(\)</span> = <em>yes</em><span class="math inline">\() = 0.0392\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P(\)</span> = <em>lived</em> <span class="math inline">\(|\)</span> = <em>yes</em><span class="math inline">\() = 0.9754\)</span> to determine the probability that a person was both inoculated and lived.<a href="#fn32" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Guided Practice</strong></p>
<p>If 97.45% of the people who were inoculated lived, what proportion of inoculated people must have died</p>

<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span>, ..., <span class="math inline">\(A_k\)</span> represent all the disjoint outcomes for a variable or process. Then if <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is an event, possibly for another variable or process, we have: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
P(A_1|B)+\cdots+P(A_k|B) = 1\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The rule for complements also holds when an event and its complement are conditioned on the same information: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
P(A | B) = 1 - P(A^c | B)\end{aligned}\]</span></p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">10.2.6</span> Tree diagrams</h3>
<p><strong>Tree diagrams</strong> are a tool to organize outcomes and probabilities around the structure of the data. They are most useful when two or more processes occur in a sequence and each process is conditioned on its predecessors.</p>
<p>The data fit this description. We see the population as split by : <em>yes</em> and <em>no</em>. Following this split, survival rates were observed for each group. This structure is reflected in the *tree diagram<strong> shown in Figure <a href="probability.html#smallpoxTreeDiagram" reference-type="ref" reference="smallpoxTreeDiagram">1.9</a>. The first branch for is said to be the </strong>primary<strong> branch while the other branches are </strong>secondary** .</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">A tree diagram of the data set.<span label="smallpoxTreeDiagram"></span></p>
</div>
<p>Tree diagrams are annotated with marginal and conditional probabilities, as shown in Figure <a href="probability.html#smallpoxTreeDiagram" reference-type="ref" reference="smallpoxTreeDiagram">1.9</a>. This tree diagram splits the smallpox data by innoculation into the <em>yes</em> and <em>no</em> groups with respective marginal probabilities 0.0392 and 0.9608. The secondary branches are conditioned on the first, so we assign conditional probabilities to these branches. For example, the top branch in Figure <a href="probability.html#smallpoxTreeDiagram" reference-type="ref" reference="smallpoxTreeDiagram">1.9</a> is the probability that result = <em>lived</em> conditioned on the information that innoculated = <em>yes</em>. We may (and usually do) construct joint probabilities at the end of each branch in our tree by multiplying the numbers we come across as we move from left to right. These joint probabilities are computed using the General Multiplication Rule: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
&amp;&amp; P(\text{inoculated = yes and result = lived}) \\
    &amp;&amp;\quad = P(\text{inoculated = yes})\times P(\text{result = lived}|\text{inoculated = yes}) \\
    &amp;&amp;\quad = 0.0392\times 0.9754=0.0382\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Consider the midterm and final for a statistics class. Suppose 13% of students earned an <em>A</em> on the midterm. Of those students who earned an <em>A</em> on the midterm, 47% received an <em>A</em> on the final, and 11% of the students who earned lower than an <em>A</em> on the midterm received an <em>A</em> on the final. You randomly pick up a final exam and notice the student received an <em>A</em>. What is the probability that this student earned an <em>A</em> on the midterm</p>
<p>The end-goal is to find <span class="math inline">\(P(\text{midterm = A} | \text{final = A})\)</span>. To calculate this conditional probability, we need the following probabilities: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
P(\text{midterm = A and final = A}) \qquad\text{and}\qquad
P(\text{final = A})\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>However, this information is not provided, and it is not obvious how to calculate these probabilities. Since we aren’t sure how to proceed, it is useful to organize the information into a tree diagram, as shown in Figure <a href="probability.html#testTree" reference-type="ref" reference="testTree">1.10</a>. When constructing a tree diagram, variables provided with marginal probabilities are often used to create the tree’s primary branches; in this case, the marginal probabilities are provided for midterm grades. The final grades, which correspond to the conditional probabilities provided, will be shown on the secondary branches.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="figures/testTree/testTree.png" alt="A tree diagram describing the and variables." id="testTree" style="width:87.0%" />
<p class="caption">A tree diagram describing the and variables.<span label="testTree"></span></p>
</div>
<p>With the tree diagram constructed, we may compute the required probabilities: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
&amp;&amp;P(\text{midterm = A and final = A}) = 0.0611 \\
&amp;&amp;P(\text{final = A})  \\
&amp;&amp; \quad= P(\text{midterm = other and final = A}) + P(\text{midterm = A and final = A}) \\
&amp;&amp; \quad= 0.0611 + 0.0957 = 0.1568\end{aligned}\]</span> The marginal probability, <span class="math inline">\(P(\)</span> = <em>A</em><span class="math inline">\()\)</span>, was calculated by adding up all the joint probabilities on the right side of the tree that correspond to = <em>A</em>. We may now finally take the ratio of the two probabilities: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
P(\text{midterm = A} | \text{final = A}) &amp;=&amp; \frac{P(\text{midterm = A and final = A})}{P(\text{final = A})} \\
&amp;=&amp; \frac{0.0611}{0.1568} = 0.3897\end{aligned}\]</span> The probability the student also earned an A on the midterm is about 0.39.</p>

<p>Around 20 students will not buy either book (0 books total), about 55 will buy one book (55 books total), and approximately 25 will buy two books (totaling 50 books for these 25 students). The bookstore should expect to sell about 105 books for this class.</p>

<p>The expected value for a random variable represents the average outcome.

This is represented in Figures <a href="probability.html#bookCostDist" reference-type="ref" reference="bookCostDist">1.11</a> and <a href="probability.html#bookWts" reference-type="ref" reference="bookWts">1.12</a>. The idea of a center of gravity also expands to continuous probability distributions. Figure <a href="probability.html#contBalance" reference-type="ref" reference="contBalance">1.13</a> shows a continuous probability distribution balanced atop a wedge placed at the mean.</p>

<p>Suppose you ran the university bookstore. Besides how much revenue you expect to generate, you might also want to know the volatility (variability) in your revenue.</p>
<p>The and can be used to describe the variability of a random variable. We first computed deviations from the mean (<span class="math inline">\(x_i - \mu\)</span>), squared those deviations, and took an average to get the variance. In the case of a random variable, we again compute squared deviations. However, we take their sum weighted by their corresponding probabilities, just like we did for the expectation. This weighted sum of squared deviations equals the variance, and we calculate the standard deviation by taking the square root of the variance.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">10.3.3</span> Linear combinations of random variables</h3>
<p>So far, we have thought of each variable as being a complete story in and of itself. Sometimes it is more appropriate to use a combination of variables. For instance, the amount of time a person spends commuting to work each week can be broken down into several daily commutes. Similarly, the total gain or loss in a stock portfolio is the sum of the gains and losses in its components.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>John travels to work five days a week. We will use <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> to represent his travel time on Monday, <span class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span> to represent his travel time on Tuesday, and so on. Write an equation using <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span>, ..., <span class="math inline">\(X_5\)</span> that represents his travel time for the week, denoted by <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>. His total weekly travel time is the sum of the five daily values: <span class="math display">\[W = X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4 + X_5\]</span> Breaking the weekly travel time <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> into pieces provides a framework for understanding each source of randomness and is useful for modeling <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>It takes John an average of 18 minutes each day to commute to work. What would you expect his average commute time to be for the week</p>
<p>We were told that the average (i.e. expected value) of the commute time is 18 minutes per day: <span class="math inline">\(E(X_i) = 18\)</span>. To get the expected time for the sum of the five days, we can add up the expected time for each individual day: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
E(W) &amp;= E(X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4 + X_5) \\
    &amp;= E(X_1) + E(X_2) + E(X_3) + E(X_4) + E(X_5) \\
    &amp;= 18 + 18 + 18 + 18 + 18 = 90\text{ minutes}\end{aligned}\]</span> The expectation of the total time is equal to the sum of the expected individual times. More generally, the expectation of a sum of random variables is always the sum of the expectation for each random variable.</p>
<p><strong>Guided Practice</strong></p>
<p>Elena is selling a TV at a cash auction and also intends to buy a toaster oven in the auction. If <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> represents the profit for selling the TV and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> represents the cost of the toaster oven, write an equation that represents the net change in Elena’s cash.<a href="#fn41" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>Based on past auctions, Elena figures she should expect to make about $175 on the TV and pay about $23 for the toaster oven. In total, how much should she expect to make or spend</p>
<p><a href="#fn42" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Guided Practice</strong></p>
<p>Would you be surprised if John’s weekly commute wasn’t exactly 90 minutes or if Elena didn’t make exactly $152</p>
<p>Explain.<a href="#fn43" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>Two important concepts concerning combinations of random variables have so far been introduced. First, a final value can sometimes be described as the sum of its parts in an equation. Second, intuition suggests that putting the individual average values into this equation gives the average value we would expect in total. This second point needs clarification – it is guaranteed to be true in what are called <em>linear combinations of random variables</em>.</p>
<p>A <strong>Linear Combination</strong> of two random variables <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is a fancy phrase to describe a combination <span class="math display">\[aX + bY\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are some fixed and known numbers. For John’s commute time, there were five random variables – one for each work day – and each random variable could be written as having a fixed coefficient of 1: <span class="math display">\[1X_1 + 1 X_2 + 1 X_3 + 1 X_4 + 1 X_5\]</span> For Elena’s net gain or loss, the <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> random variable had a coefficient of +1 and the <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> random variable had a coefficient of -1.</p>
<p>When considering the average of a linear combination of random variables, it is safe to plug in the mean of each random variable and then compute the final result. For a few examples of nonlinear combinations of random variables – cases where we cannot simply plug in the means – see the footnote.<a href="#fn44" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Linear combinations of random variables and the average result</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> are random variables, then a linear combination of the random variables is given by <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\label{linComboOfRandomVariablesXAndY}
aX + bY\end{aligned}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are some fixed numbers. To compute the average value of a linear combination of random variables, plug in the average of each individual random variable and compute the result: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
a\times E(X) + b\times E(Y)\end{aligned}\]</span> Recall that the expected value is the same as the mean, e.g. <span class="math inline">\(E(X) = \mu_X\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Leonard has invested $6000 in Google Inc. (stock ticker: GOOG) and $2000 in Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM). If <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> represents the change in Google’s stock next month and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> represents the change in Exxon Mobil stock next month, write an equation that describes how much money will be made or lost in Leonard’s stocks for the month. For simplicity, we will suppose <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> are not in percents but are in decimal form (e.g. if Google’s stock increases 1%, then <span class="math inline">\(X=0.01\)</span>; or if it loses 1%, then <span class="math inline">\(X=-0.01\)</span>). Then we can write an equation for Leonard’s gain as <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\$6000\times X + \$2000\times Y\end{aligned}\]</span> If we plug in the change in the stock value for <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, this equation gives the change in value of Leonard’s stock portfolio for the month. A positive value represents a gain, and a negative value represents a loss.</p>
<p><strong>Guided Practice</strong></p>
<p>Suppose Google and Exxon Mobil stocks have recently been rising 2.1% and 0.4% per month, respectively. Compute the expected change in Leonard’s stock portfolio for next month.<a href="#fn45" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Guided Practice</strong></p>
<p>You should have found that Leonard expects a positive gain. However, would you be surprised if he actually had a loss this month</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">10.3.4</span> Variability in linear combinations of random variables</h3>
<p>Quantifying the average outcome from a linear combination of random variables is helpful, but it is also important to have some sense of the uncertainty associated with the total outcome of that combination of random variables. We calculated the expected net gain or loss of Leonard’s stock portfolio was considered in Guided Practice. However, there was no quantitative discussion of the volatility of this portfolio. For instance, while the average monthly gain might be about $134 according to the data, that gain is not guaranteed. Figure <a href="probability.html#changeInLeonardsStockPortfolioFor36Months" reference-type="ref" reference="changeInLeonardsStockPortfolioFor36Months">1.14</a> shows the monthly changes in a portfolio like Leonard’s during the 36 months from 2009 to 2011. The gains and losses vary widely, and quantifying these fluctuations is important when investing in stocks.</p>

</div>
<p>Just as we have done in many previous cases, we use the variance and standard deviation to describe the uncertainty associated with Leonard’s monthly returns. To do so, the variances of each stock’s monthly return will be useful, and these are shown in the table below. The stocks’ returns are nearly independent.</p>

<p>Here we use an equation from probability theory to describe the uncertainty of Leonard’s monthly returns; we leave the proof of this method to a dedicated probability course. The variance of a linear combination of random variables can be computed by plugging in the variances of the individual random variables and squaring the coefficients of the random variables: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
Var(aX + bY) = a^2\times Var(X) + b^2\times Var(Y)\end{aligned}\]</span> It is important to note that this equality assumes the random variables are independent; if independence doesn’t hold, then more advanced methods are necessary. This equation can be used to compute the variance of Leonard’s monthly return: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
Var(6000\times X + 2000\times Y)
    &amp;= 6000^2\times Var(X) + 2000^2\times Var(Y) \\
    &amp;= 36,000,000\times 0.0072 + 4,000,000\times 0.0027 \\
    &amp;= 270,000\end{aligned}\]</span> The standard deviation is computed as the square root of the variance: <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{270,000} = \$520\)</span>. While an average monthly return of $134 on an $8000 investment is nothing to scoff at, the monthly returns are so volatile that Leonard should not expect this income to be very stable.</p>
<p><strong>Variability of linear combinations of random variables</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The variance of a linear combination of random variables may be computed by squaring the constants, substituting in the variances for the random variables, and computing the result: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
Var(aX + bY) = a^2\times Var(X) + b^2\times Var(Y)\end{aligned}\]</span> This equation is valid as long as the random variables are independent of each other. The standard deviation of the linear combination may be found by taking the square root of the variance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Suppose John’s daily commute has a standard deviation of 4 minutes. What is the uncertainty in his total commute time for the week</p>
<p>The expression for John’s commute time was <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4 + X_5\end{aligned}\]</span> Each coefficient is 1, and the variance of each day’s time is <span class="math inline">\(4^2=16\)</span>. Thus, the variance of the total weekly commute time is <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
&amp;\text{variance }= 1^2 \times  16 + 1^2 \times  16 + 1^2 \times  16 + 1^2 \times  16 + 1^2 \times  16 = 5\times 16 = 80 \\
&amp;\text{standard deviation } = \sqrt{\text{variance}} = \sqrt{80} = 8.94\end{aligned}\]</span> The standard deviation for John’s weekly work commute time is about 9 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Guided Practice</strong></p>
<p>The computation in the example above relied on an important assumption: the commute time for each day is independent of the time on other days of that week. Do you think this is valid</p>
<p>Explain.<a href="#fn47" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Guided Practice</strong> Elena is selling a TV at a cash auction and also intends to buy a toaster oven in the auction. If <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> represents the profit for selling the TV and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> represents the cost of the toaster oven. Suppose these auctions are approximately independent and the variability in auction prices associated with the TV and toaster oven can be described using standard deviations of $25 and $8. Compute the standard deviation of Elena’s net gain.<a href="#fn48" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>The negative coefficient for <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> in the linear combination was eliminated when we squared the coefficients. This generally holds true: negatives in a linear combination will have no impact on the variability computed for a linear combination, but they do impact the expected value computations.</p>
