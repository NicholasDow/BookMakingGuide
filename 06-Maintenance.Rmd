### Why We Use Travis

It takes a long time for the computer to compile a bookdown book, so we use travis so that that compilation can happen independently on the travis servers. Basically what happens is travis will take your code and the compilation language and run your files in an indpendent enviroment that is displayed through netifly. This is called **continuos integration** and is what the the ci in travis stands for. Travis also lets you check for mistakes via tests, most developers use it for this purpose alone.
