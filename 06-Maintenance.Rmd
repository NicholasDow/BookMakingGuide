### How to paste into the rstudio terminal

`Shift + Insert`

### Making Lazy Git

```
function lazygit() {
    git add .
    git commit -a -m "$1"
    git push
}
```
You can copy and paste this command into your terminal to get a command that allows you to add commit and push all in one line. However your terminal will not remember everytime you reload. Thankfully there is a file where all your commands can be saved. 



<!-- How we include images -->
<!-- ```{r R-vs-RStudio-1, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Analogy of difference between R and RStudio.", out.width='95%', purl=FALSE} -->
<!-- knitr::include_graphics("images/shutterstock/R_vs_RStudio_1.png") -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- how we include code -->
<!-- ```{r echo = T, results = 'hide'} -->

1. `Window Key + Shift and then press S` to take a screenshot 
2. Open paint and paste into the file
3. Save image into a `~/images` folder inside of the project
4. We type this command into the markdown file, without the quotation marks around the curly brackets
```"{r R-vs-RStudio-1, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='95%', purl=FALSE}"
knitr::include_graphics("images/Example_Screenshot.png")
```
```{r R-vs-RStudio-1, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='95%', purl=FALSE}

### Why we use travis

It takes a long time for the computer to compile a bookdown book, so we use travis so that that compilation can happen independently on the travis servers. Basically what happens is travis will take your code and the compilation language and run your files in an indpendent enviroment that is displayed through netifly. This is called **continuos integration** and is what the the ci in travis stands for.
