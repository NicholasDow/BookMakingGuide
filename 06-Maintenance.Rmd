### How to paste into the rstudio terminal

`Shift + Insert`

### Making Lazy Git

```
function lazygit() {
    git add .
    git commit -a -m "$1"
    git push
}
```
You can copy and paste this command into your terminal to get a command that allows you to add commit and push all in one line. However your terminal will not remember everytime you reload. Thankfully there is a file where all your commands can be saved.
