# GH pages docs folder method

(**Note** `bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd')` to render the whole book)

(**Note** `preview_chapter()` for single chapters) but as Yihui says: 
>One downside of previewing a chapter is that the cross-references to other chapters will not work, since bookdown knows nothing about other chapters in this case. That is a reasonably small price to pay for the gain in speed. Since previewing a chapter only renders the output for that specific chapter, you should not expect that the content of other chapters is correctly rendered as well. For example, when you navigate to a different chapter, you are actually viewing the old output of that chapter (which may not even exist).

<!-- A lot of MD chapters probably won't work because of how much cross-referencing there is. A solution to this is to add a `common.R` file to each chapter with `source('common.R')`, but this might be more trouble than using travis. Tell me if you want to do this. -->

9) In this step we are going to copy in the MD Repo, specifically excluding files that we don't need. You should be in the directory with your `index.Rmd` file when issuing these commands

  + `git clone https://github.com/moderndive/ModernDive_book.git` __This line clones the repository__

  + `shopt -s extglob` __This line enables regular expressions to be used in bash commands__

  + `cp -r ./ModernDive_book/!(docs|.DS_store|.git|*.Rproj|previous_versions|.travis.yml|_build.sh|_deploy.sh) .` __This line copies all the files that are needed into the main directory. Without the shopt command we couldn't use !(docs|...) to reference files__
  
  + `rm -r ./ModernDive_book` __This removes the directory__


<!-- 10) Go into `_bookdown.yml` and change the repo line so that it refers to your directory `repo: https://github.com/Nameofuser/nameofrepo`.  -->

10) Run the command `bookdown::clean_book(TRUE); bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd', 'bookdown::gitbook');` to get a version of the book's html files written into your docs folder. This will overwrite the html files that were previously in the docs folder.

11) Push the new html files, and GH will render a website from them.
