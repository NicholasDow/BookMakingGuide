# From Scratch

## From My template
If you fork or clone from the repository of this book you should be able to pick up from the 6th step of the introduction

https://github.com/NicholasDow/BookMakingGuide

I need to update the read me.

Here is what each of the files does:

Docs- where all rendered files will be placed

Images- where all images are stored

renv- where a local library that runs on travis is located. You must update this library with `renv::restore()`

.Rprofile- I don't really know not relevent to us. I think it keeps track of the Rstudio instance

.gitignore- contains a list of all the files that need to be ignored when interacting with github

.travis.yml- controls how travis is run when the repo is pushed to github and ultimately run with continuous integration

- a note about pandoc, the setting inside travis. Pandoc is a markdown converter


chapter.Rmd- These files are your chapters

Readme.md- text for github

_bookdown.yml- where chapters are ordered

_output.yml- how the rendering of different file types is defined

index.rmd- the main markdown file, render this one to render the whole book

renv.lock- contains all the names of the libraries that are run on travis and are nessisary to run all of the rmd files.

style.css- how do you want to define your html. this file does that
